# Useful Programs and Scripts: a list

## Creative programs

* Audacity
* VLC
* ffmpeg/ffplay/ffprobe
* Kdenlive
* OBS Studio
* Aitum Multistream Plugin for OBS Studio (allows you to stream to multiple streaming services at once at no cost, without setting up a RTMP protocol relay server yourself to broadcast to multiple services or relying on paid services, e.g. to stream to YouTube Live and Twitch at the same time)
* GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)
* Krita
* Affinity Suite/Affinity (now free of charge)
* VEGAS video editor
* DaVinci Resolve
* Ardour
* Handbrake
* youtube-dl/yt-dlp
* LibreOffice (LibreOffice Draw is something I've started using for creating print designs, since it works well across system platforms)
* Inkscape
* Fluidsynth (I use it to convert MIDI files to compressed audio file formats like WAV or MP3, using soundfonts, so that I can listen to them the way the original MIDI artist intended, e.g. using a Roland SC-55 soundfont vs a Yamaha XG-1 soundfont)
* optipng/pngcrush/pngout/pngnq/DeflOpt (PNG image format re-compression and optimization utilities, especially helpful for reducing filesize of PNGs for websites)
* UVR 5 (Python-based program to isolate either vocals or instruments from songs)

## Networking programs

* Docker/podman (podman runs Docker containers without 'root' access by default)
* OPNsense/pfSense (network-level firewall operating systems)
* dig (get DNS record)
* whois (get domain name whois records, which contains useful information about domain registration, like e.g. if domain registration privacy is enabled to not give away potentially personal contact info)
* Pi-hole (DNS-based ad/domain blocker. I typically also add certain domains to my personal allow- and block- lists)
* Invidious (self-hosted YouTube client without the fluff and without 'The Algorhithm' tracking you along the way)
* SearXNG (privacy-respecting, self-hosted search engine that scrapes a bunch of search engines for more thorough and wide-reaching results)
* PaperMC (optimized, better-performing Minecraft server than Mojang's stock server provided)
* ufw/Uncomplicated Firewall (individual system-level firewall, e.g. to block/reject incoming connections even originating from the same local network)

## Doom editing utilties ('doomstuff')

* SLADE
* Doom Builder/GZDoom Builder/Ultimate Doom Builder (can easily run on Linux with help from Proton, without messing around with manually setting up the Mono .NET framework)

## Diablo II (classic version) utilities ('diablo2stuff')

* Sven's GLIDE3-to-OpenGL wrapper (translates 3dfx's GLIDE3 graphics library to the standard OpenGL graphics library on-the-fly, and allows other things, e.g. running the game in a window and confining the mouse cursor to the game window)
* PlugY (among many other things, allows multiple stash item tabs, since I always run out of stash space in the stock game)
* Mastadex's Hero Editor, Zonfire99 edition (I like to create custom items sometimes to mess around in single player!)
