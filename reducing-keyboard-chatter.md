I have a Razer BlackWidow V3 Quartz pink mechanical keyboard, and often times pressing keys results in 2-3 presses, which is common for mechanical keyboards, and often referred to as keyboard "chatter".

# On KDE Plasma 6:

1. System Settings -> Input & Output -> Keyboard -> Enable “Key repeat” with checkbox, if not already enabled.
2. Then change “Delay” next to it at about or at least 750 ms (ms = milliseconds) NOTE: the default delay is usually set to 600 ms.
3. If the issue persists, try disabling “Key repeat” all together, so that holding down the same key only presses repeatedly very, very slowly. I personally don’t do this because I often hold backspace to erase text, out of habit, and if this option is disabled, doing this is painfully slow.

Other operating systems and desktop environments have similar settings for key repeating.
